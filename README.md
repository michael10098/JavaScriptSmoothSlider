This is a one file html file example of how to use jquery sliderUp and sliderDown to open and close sliders.

Here is the example: https://githubbox.com/michael10098/JavaScriptSmoothSlider

If no sliders are open, then it opens the one clicked.

If another slider is open, then it closes that slider and opens the one clicked.

If the clicked slider is open, then it closes it.
